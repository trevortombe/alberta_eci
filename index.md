The following compiles monthly data from a variety of courses to estimate real-time economic conditions in Alberta. It closely follows, as much as the data allows, the [Chicago Fed National Activity Index](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/cfnai/index). These estimates will be periodically updated, and typically come with a two to three month lag before all the necessary monday data is available from Statistics Canada.

The Alberta ECI provides a strong indication of overall economic conditions. At an annual frequency, it is highly correlated with measured changes in Alberta's real GDP.
